Write a program which takes a decimal value and two ISO 4217 currency codes and computes the value of the other currency given a fixed conversion rate. If one of the currency codes is not known the program should print an error. When run without any arguments the program should print some usage information including a list of all known currency codes for which it has conversion rates.
