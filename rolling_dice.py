A.3 Roll the Dice

Write a program which simulates one or more dice with values from 1 to 6. The program takes a single argument which is the number of dice. The output should contain the values of the dice and the probability for this combination to occur. The probability is expressed as a decimal value between 0 and 1 with three decimal points.

$ roll-the-dice 3
Rolling 3 dice ...
4 2 8 (Probability: 0.473)
Ext 1: Extend the program so that it can roll dice with any number of sides greater than 1.
