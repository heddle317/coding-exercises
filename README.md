# coding-exercises
-----------------

These are a bunch of coding exercises I found in a blog -> https://go-left.com/blog/programming/100-little-programming-exercises/  
I'll add more over time as I find them.  

* Fork the repository to start doing the code challenges.  
* Open a pull request with an empty code challenge (that includes its instructions) to add to this repo.
